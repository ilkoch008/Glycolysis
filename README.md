# Glycolysis

### Introduction
This repository discusses some solutions to the equation describing the simplest glycolysis model.

This equation is given below.

Here you can find the implementation of 4 methods.

They are:
  1. Explicit Euler Method
  2. Implicit trapezoid method
  3. Implicit Euler Method
  4. Four Step Fourth Order Runge-Kutta Method

Now we will consider each method separately.

### Explicit Euler Method
